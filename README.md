ATM Cash Withdrawal Simulator
This project is a JavaScript program that simulates an ATM cash withdrawal process. The program allows users to input the desired amount to withdraw and then calculates the optimal combination of notes to fulfill the request based on the available denominations stored in the ATM. It utilizes recursion to explore different combinations and provides detailed output showing the denomination and number of notes received by the user after the transaction. Additionally, it displays the remaining count of each denomination in the ATM after the transaction.
